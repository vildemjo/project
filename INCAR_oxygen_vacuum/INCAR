INCAR for high-accuracy total energy calculation.

! Electronic relaxation
ALGO   = Fast      ! Algorithm for electronic relaxation
NELMIN = 4         ! Minimum # of electronic steps
EDIFF  = 1E-5      ! Accuracy for electronic groundstate
ENCUT  = 500       ! Cut-off energy for plane wave expansion
PREC   = Normal    ! Low/Normal/Accurate
LREAL  = Auto      ! Projection in reciprocal space?
ISMEAR = -5        ! Smearing of partial occupancies.
SIGMA  = 0.2       ! Smearing width
ISPIN  = 1         ! Spin polarization?

! Ionic relaxation
NSW    = 0         ! Final high-accuracy calculation without relaxation

! Output options
LWAVE  = .FALSE.   ! Write WAVECAR?


! Memory handling
NPAR    = 4        ! Should be = sqrt(cpus)
