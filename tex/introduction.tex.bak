In my master thesis I will look at n-type dopant diffusion in the semiconductor $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$. This diffusion is believed to be oxygen vacancy aided and dependent. In this project the three different oxygen vacancies in $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ was studied with density functional theory.

We started with convergence tests of the primitive unit $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$, both with respect to cut-off energy and k-point density. We also looked at the density of states and plotted the band structure of $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$.

After that, we increased the unit cell size to a super cell. This, to be able to insert an oxygen vacancy. We relaxed the structure and calculated the energy of the bulk $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$.

After that we made three different supercells each with an oxygen vacancy at different oxygen sites. We relaxed the structure and then calculated the total energy. To find the formation energy of the different oxygen vacancies, the energy of an oxygen molecule in vacuum was calculated as well. 

At last local density of state was used to investigate the oxygen vacancy further.
