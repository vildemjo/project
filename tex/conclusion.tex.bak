DFT calculations on the semiconductor $\beta\text{-Ga}_2\text{O}_3$ was done to find out which of the three inequivalent oxygen vacancies is the most stable one. We started with convergence tests of the primitive unit $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$, both with respect to cut-off energy and k-point density. After that we made three different supercells each with an oxygen vacancy at different oxygen sites. We relaxed the structure and then calculated the total energy.

This was done by calculating the formation energy of the vacancies. The formation energy was calculated by calculating the total energies of a supercell of the material with and without the vacancy. The total energy of the O$_2$ in vacuum was used to find the necessary chemical potential of oxygen. The O(I) oxygen vacancy was found to be the most stable one. 

In the end, electron density isosurfaces and density of states plots were used to evaluate why the O(I) vacancy had the lowest formation energy. There reason for the stability of the O(I) vacancy seems to come from the surrounding gallium atoms. The O(I) vacancy has two Ga(I) and one Ga(II) as nearest neighbors, and the others has only one Ga(I) atom. The two Ga(I) atoms seemed to form a bond when the oxygen atom was missing.

The results from this project is very dependent on the condition of the material. We assumed it to be in oxygen rich conditions, and we assumed the oxygen vacancy to be uncharged. The temperature was O K. By changing these conditions, the result might change, and that is something that can be done to continue the work. The stability of the vacancy will probably change with both oxygen conditions (is that the pressure \ref. ) and temperature.

Another change that can be done is to use hybrid functionals in the density of states calculations and to extract the band structure. That would probably fix the band structure issue in this project, at least the band gap.
