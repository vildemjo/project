\subsection{Set up}

Type of GGA.

\subsection{Execution}

\begin{itemize}

\item Found structure for $\beta- \text{Ga}_2\text{O}_3$

\item Checked convergence for energy cut off and k-point density for primitive unit cell

\item Convergence criteria result:
\subitem ENCUT = 600
\subitem makekpoints -d 5 $\rightarrow$ (3x11x6)

\item Relaxed the unit cell

\item Plotted DOS and band structure for primitive unit cell

\item Made super cell (1x 3y 2z)

\item Changed convergence criteria:
\subitem EDIFFG = -0.01
\subitem ENCUT = 500
\subitem ISIF = 3
\subitem makekpoints -d 3 $\rightarrow$ (2x3x2)

\item Relaxed super cell (both electronic and pressure)

\item Calculated energy for relaxed unit cell

\item Made three different structures for three different oxygen vacancies

\item Relaxed all three structures

\item Calculated energy for the relaxed structures

\item Calculated energy of oxygen molecule in vacuum
\subitem EDIFFG = -0.01
\subitem ENCUT = 500
\subitem ISIF = 3
\subitem makekpoints -d 3 $\rightarrow$ (2x3x2)

\item Found formation energy 

\item Plotted local DOS near vacancy and far away from it

\end{itemize}
