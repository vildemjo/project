This project is a part of the course FYS-MENA4111. DFT calculations on the semiconductor $\beta\text{-Ga}_2\text{O}_3$ was done to find out which of the three inequivalent oxygen vacancies is the most stable one. This was done by calculating the formation energy of the vacancies. The formation energy was calculated by calculating the total energies of a supercell of the material with and without the vacancy. The total energy of the O$_2$ in vacuum was used to find the necessary chemical potential of oxygen. The O(I) oxygen vacancy was found to be the most stable one. In the end electron density isosurfaces and density of states plots were used to evaluate why the O(I) vacancy had the lowest formation energy.
